# OPENAI SPEECH API

The OpenAI Speech API (TTS) produces audio at 24 kHz sample rate in mono format. The API does not currently provide options to control or change the sample rate.

Audio Format Details
The text-to-speech endpoint outputs 24 kHz mono audio with 16-bit PCM encoding when using uncompressed formats. For the Realtime API, the input audio format specification requires 24 kHz mono PCM as well.
